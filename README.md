# Forget-Me-Not
Forget Me Not is an android app designed to help patients suffering from mild to
moderate forms of memory impairing diseases like dementia and alzheimer&#39;s, and to
help reduce the burden on their caretakers.
Our intention is to enhance the social and the cognitive aspects of the patient’s life,
while simultaneously reducing the emotional and financial burden placed on the
caretaker.
With this app, the patient’s mental health will not deteriorate at a much slower pace.
The patient becomes more independent, and as a consequence, the caretaker’s
tasks also decrease.
Our app has the following features:
1. Location based tracking to inform the caretaker by SMS when the patient
crosses a certain radius beyond his home.
2. Scheduler- set by the caretaker, notifying the patient to complete a certain
task.
3. Prevention of repeated calling- A feature that will remind the patient if he tries
to call a certain person multiple times within a five minute restraint.
4. Inclusion of a Newsfeed and a Music-feed to recommend news articles and
music clips to the patients based on his previous interests and the caretaker’s
input.
5. Games that stimulate the patient’s brain and train his cognitive skills.
6. A facial recognition feature where the caretaker uploads pictures of the most
important people to the patient. If the patient finds himself confused when he
encounters one of them, he simply needs to open the feature. Their name, will
pop up. Note: this feature could be buggy as we didn&#39;t have enough time to
fix it
